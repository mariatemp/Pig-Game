## 📖 Game Rules

1. **Objective**: The first player to reach **100 points** wins the game.
2. **Gameplay**:
   - Each player takes turns rolling the dice.
   - If the dice roll is greater than `1`, its value is added to the **current score**.
   - Rolling a `1` resets the **current score**, and the turn passes to the other player.
   - Players can choose to **hold** their current score, adding it to their **total score** and switching turns.
3. **Winning**:
   - When a player’s total score reaches **100 points**, they win the game, and the interface highlights the winner.
